# linuxkarl's AstroNvim configuration
## It's Cool.

I haven't done much, just adapted it to my preferences, added tokyonight theme, configured 
it to work with python as well as lua, and also added in plugins to work with a local LLM, 
for coding with the help of an AI (using gen.nvim).

**NOTE:** This is for AstroNvim v4+
